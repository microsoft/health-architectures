# Azure API for FHIR

![Microsoft and FHIR](/assets/images/msft-fhir.png)

Azure API for FHIR allows users to easily create and deploy a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) service for health data solutions.  The Microsoft Health Teams have built reference architectures, tools and solutions to help customers fully integrate Azure API for FHIR solutions with existing healthcare solutions.

Unless otherwise noted the solutions in this repo work with both the Azure API for FHIR and there is also a managed offering in Azure called the [Azure API for FHIR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/fhir-paas-portal-quickstart) PaaS Service. The [FHIR Server for Azure](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server) is an open-source implementation of the emerging HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) specification designed for the Microsoft cloud.
