# Azure FHIR Ingestion 

Healthcare organizations continue to face a variety of challenges with their data. There is a virtual explosion in the amount of collected information, fragmentation of data and formats across providers and care teams, spiraling cost escalation, and a shortage of staff and resources to keep up with the workload.

However, with technology rapidly changing and growing, adopting it may seem like a daunting prospect for many healthcare organizations that also need to follow compliance regulations and ensure data security. 

The good news is that it is possible to achieve HIPAA compliance while also implementing cloud technologies to store and utilize health data to make smarter decisions.  Weâ€™ve innovated the way healthcare organizations can enrich, normalize and unify protected health information (PHI) from on-premise systems into and through Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR).
