# Welcome to SmokeJumpers Jekyll Site
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole site, values
# which are expected to be set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing these this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.github_repo }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

# Config notes:
# change site to health-architectures when moving
